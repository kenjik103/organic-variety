Tutorial by [Jasper Flick](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/organic-variety/)

An extention of the [Fractal](https://github.com/kenjik103/animated-fractal) project. Rendering was done in more or less the same way, but this time random variences in color, smoothness, and rotation speed were introduced to make the fractal appear more organic. Sagging was also introduced to make it look like gravity had an effect, which required a lot of vector math.
